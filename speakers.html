        <h6>Designing a culture of design</h6><!-- Text transform uppercase -->
        <article>
          <p>Workplace culture doesn't start with beanbags, foosball tables
          or a beer fridge, and it doesn't end with neckties, PCs, or big
          corporations. It's the unwritten rules, behavior, beliefs, and
          the motivations that enable good work to get done, or it's what
          stifles a workforce. For design to be most effective, and
          designers to feel valued, we need to work in a culture that
          embraces design and allows it to succeed.</p>
          <p>In Aaron's session he will explore how to recognize the traits
          of organization that *get* design, both large and small. He will
          share what those teams, departments, and companies have that others
          don't, and more importantly, how to begin to change your own
          workplace's culture. Once you've worked within a culture of design
          it's almost impossible to imagine yourself anywhere else.</p>

        <h6>Lights! Camera! Interaction! Design inspiration from
        filmmakers</h6><!-- Text transform uppercase -->
        <article>
          <p>Films succeed in evoking responses and engaging audiences only
          with a combination of well-written narrative and effective
          storytelling technique. It’s the filmmaker’s job to put this
          together. To do so they’ve developed processes, tools and
          techniques that allow them to focus attention, emphasize
          information, foreshadow and produce the many elements that together
          comprise a well-told story.</p>
          <p>With this workshop, we’ll revisit the topic of using stories
          in design and expand on the technical aspects used in film to
          communicate. We’ll look at some tools used in film, such as
          cinematic patterns, beat sheets, and storyboards. We’ll consider why
          they’re used and how we might look to them for inspiration.</p>

        </h6><!-- Text transform uppercase -->
        <article>
          <p>Static wireframes are a drag on the whole design process.
          Prototyping makes things a little better by allowing you to stitch
          together static wireframes or mockups while adding basic
          interactions. Rapid prototyping with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is
          even better and faster; it increases collaboration and improves the
          iteration process. Kill your wireframes. Long live rapid
          prototyping.</p>
